# Chicken Dinner Winner Picker

### You know how some organizations like a high school band purchase a bunch of raffle tickets because there's a fund raiser every few months? Well this program allows the user save money by finishing off the left over rolls of tickets, save time by not having to individually rip tickets when someone purchases an entire strip, and helps prevent paper cuts when randomly picking a ticket. The user inputs a starting ticket number as well as an ending ticket number. The program randomly chooses a ticket in the range provided.

## What I used
Python

## Optimizations
I plan changing this into a beatiful and easy to use GUI so organizations can use this if there is no wifi available at a venue.
